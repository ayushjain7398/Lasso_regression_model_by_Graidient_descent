# Lasso_regression_model_by_Graidient_descent
In notebook1, you will use LASSO to select features, building on a pre-implemented solver for LASSO (using GraphLab Create, though you can use other solvers). You will:
* Run LASSO with different L1 penalties.
* Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set.
* Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set, with additional constraint on the size of subset.

In  notebook2, you will implement your very own LASSO solver via coordinate descent. You will:
* Write a function to normalize features
* Implement coordinate descent for LASSO
* Explore effects of L1 penalty
